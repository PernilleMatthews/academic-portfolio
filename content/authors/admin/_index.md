I am a PhD Fellow at the Aarhus University (AU) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.au.dk/research/data-intensive-systems), collaborating with the AI 
Pioneer Centre. 

[//]: # (The AI Pioneer Centre aims to produce world-class AI research and enable interdisciplinary )
[//]: # (collaborations.)

My PhD topic is within Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), and my research focuses on clustering and outlier 
detection. As a researcher, I aim to enhance the human-machine relationship by evolving the field of XAI. XAI is a 
vital area within AI. The value of XAI is especially noticeable in high-risk domains, such as health care, and much 
work exists to use AI within high-risk fields effectively.

Besides research, work on consultancy and developer-type jobs for my company, Prime Coding ApS.
I particularly enjoy consulting with the industry by solving problems and help bring theory into practice.
